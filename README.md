This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About this project

This project displays businesses in New York City.<br>
You can load 10 businesses at a time by clicking the pink button.<br>
To view more details and 3 reviews of the business, click on the name of the business.<br>

## API used

I used [Yelp Fusion](https://www.yelp.com/fusion) along with a [CORS proxy](https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/). Yelp Fusion does not have CORS enabled and I wanted to avoid writing a server.
