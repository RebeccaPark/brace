This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About this project

This project displays businesses in New York City. You can load 10 businesses at a time by clicking the pink button. You can also filter businesses by name. If filter is applied and you click for more businesses, the filter will be unset. To view more details and 3 reviews of the business, click on the name of the business.


## API used

I used [Yelp Fusion](https://www.yelp.com/fusion) along with a [CORS proxy](https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/). Yelp Fusion does not have CORS enabled and I wanted to avoid writing a server.

## To view this project

### Dependencies

Run `yarn` to install dependencies.

### Run the server

Run `yarn start` to start the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
